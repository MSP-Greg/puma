  # Internal Docs for A simple thread pool management object.
  #
  # Each Puma "worker" has a thread pool to process requests.
  #
  # First a connection to a client is made in `Puma::Server`. It is wrapped in a
  # `Puma::Client` instance and then passed to the `Puma::Reactor` to ensure
  # the whole request is buffered into memory. Once the request is ready, it is passed into
  # a thread pool via the `Puma::ThreadPool#<<` operator where it is stored in a `@todo` array.
  #
  # Each thread in the pool has an internal loop where it pulls a request from the `@todo` array
  # and processes it.
